### Start with a Solid Foundation
JointsWP is a blank WordPress theme built with [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/), giving you all the power and flexibility you need to build complex, mobile friendly websites without having to start from scratch. This includes a grid system (far superior to the grid found in Bootstrap), basic styling for common elements, Javascript features such as an off-canvas navigation and much, much more.
